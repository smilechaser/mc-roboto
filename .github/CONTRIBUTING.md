#Overview

I will try to be very liberal in what I accept but please don't be offended if I decide your addition doesn't quite fit in. In the rare case where that happens, you're more than welcome to fork your own copy and hack away - that's the beauty of open source! ðŸ˜€

#Guidelines

In general:

1. Pull requests without an associated Issue # will be rejected
2. Fork and pull please (don't send me diffs)
3. You must be the original owner/author of the code you are committing
4. Everything you submit is subject to the license of this project (ref [LICENSE](./LICENSE))
  
##Pull requests

For pull requests:

1. Commit message must be in the form ".... fixes #nn" where nn is the GitHub issue number
2. Requests should follow the guidelines setout in the [pull template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

##Issues

For new issues:

1. State the problem clearly.
2. Use the [template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

##No-no's

Let's all be reasonable, decent human beings ok? Gotta be a good example for the robots we're creating. 

But just so that we're 100% clear:

1. Discussions must maintain a courteous and respectful tone.
2. Content must be "family friendly". If it's something that kids probably shouldn't see, then it doesn't have a place here
3. No kill-bots. Any addition that will cause/allow the robot to kill (Players or NPCs) will be rejected. The decision to kill is too important to be entrusted to a robot. I know this is just a "game robot" right now...but in the hope that it becomes more than that one day let's make sure we start off on the right foot.
