# Sooner

1. inventory
    - refactor how we deal with items - we want to be able to chat in terms of "Dark prismarine"
        rather than ```Prismarine 0 2```
    - go fish - do you have any X... (Yes/No, I have N of those items)

1. use "thing" (crafting table, chest, forge, lever, button, etc.)

# Later

- look at what I'm looking at

- nudgeable (right now when collided with by another player the agent doesn't move)

- fall when there are no blocks

- centre self in block (or nudge self to place blocks properly)

# Long-term

- acceleration when moving
- pathfinding 
- follow player

# Unsure

- build using MC-SDF blueprints
- "scan" structures into MC-SDF blueprints
