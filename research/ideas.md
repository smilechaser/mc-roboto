Here are some ideas:

1. [frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence\)?oldformat=true)
2. Prolog (is it ok that its a [Closed World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption?oldformat=true) ?)
3. Can we get the robot to adopt a cycle of:
	1. learn
	2. do
	3. teach
1. What about using the [Six Serving Men](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_serving.htm) as a Natural Language "bridge" for both representing knowledge and making requests for [more input](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/)
1. If we just have a bunch of people (esp. kids) type in things they want the robot to do (or know about) would that give us a good data set for training (i.e. Deep Learning)?
